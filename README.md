day task I create a render function which creating a row table for each time a create a instance from object and
called a render function, basically it is a dynamic data row depending on user object (instance)

Added a new form in index.html to get data from user and put it in a previous table
which's created in a previous task by using js code.

you need to know I used a js event listener to listen for a submit data and
linked it with render function to create a new row for a new employee.
